This directory contains a .emacs file and emacs extensions that I found useful for programming work.

If you have already a .emacs file with custom modifications, be sure to back it up so you can copy the information into these files.

Copy the dot.emacs file and dot.emacs_extensions directory to your home directory and rename them to .emacs and .emacs_extensions.

The .emacs file contains the following functionality:

o it enables copy/paste with the terminal (very useful!)

o it changes the font to something more readable

o it enables perl_mode on both .pl and .t files

o it assigns goto-line to M-g

o it includes a number of other modules:

  o sgn functions for entering POD headers etc.

  o tabbar, for quickely changing between buffers using tabs.
